identify with I also imagine ENTPs interrogations would go a little bit like Jacks from 24 except more mechanical Rigging up shock treatment equipment in an abandoned building out of an old car batty jumperIt was a compliment  Trust me I am just as psychopathic D except I have emoticons Theyre just weird ones Like laughing when I get hurt or at people running themselves over with their lawn mower  Its like a theme for where I live and that is why I know it by heart    I usual do not leave until the thing ends But in the mean time In between times You work your thing I will work mine D  D I am

me that most of them are stupid I know this That is why I play with them and it makes me laugh D As I am going to take Neuropsychology and I have a few psychologistD I am a Nightowl I wake up between 67pm and stay awake till 101130amPersonal opinion backed by theory would suggest that INTPs are the most socially difficult While INTJs can be socially indifferent but they will also use social situations if the the need arisesPersonal stocks that I have on my desktop that I have downloaded from random stock sites and stock photobucketsIll tell you when I open photoshop   Glad you like it staticD Thanks   Made for a friend Several hours of work I constructed every line by Static   I will have to get to your avatar later if one of my fellow teammates doesntPsychologist do not keep me
